# Dependencies
- Folktable

# TODO
- Replicate ACSIncome on different state and time (Getting Started page on Folktable's GitHub)
- Introduce some intervention methods
- Do EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) on the difference in datasets
    - Visualization distribution (Histogram, box-plot)
    - Variance, means, spread (Inter-quartile range)
    - Skewness

# Postprocess Note
- Somehow the black-white disparity is almost always better, but not for the rest of the races
